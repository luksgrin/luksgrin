## 🚀 Job

### [BioSystems Design lab 🦠➕➕](https://biosysdesign.csic.es/index.html)

My current position is PhD student at the BioSystems Design team led by Dr. Guillermo Rodrigo, where we actually do a bunch of weird stuff with synthetic biology, mathematical models, virus... I mostly do bioinformatics and day-dreaming about new crazy ideas. Most of the code I write (and push to `github`) comes from this lab work, and therefore everything is closed source 🤔. Sorry.

### [Spearbit Labs 🐱‍💻](https://spearbit.com/)

My current position is Junior Security Researcher.
I participate in Solidity (and Yul) smart contract audits.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Hackatons

TBD (`feeling lazy rn, will to some other day`).

## 📫 Contact
